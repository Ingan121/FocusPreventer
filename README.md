## What you can do with this
* Use Rainmeter (or any other application, untested yet) as a gaming overlay for fullscreen games.
  * Requires UIAccess patch + resigning with a self-signed certificate and enhanced fullscreen from Win10. (real fullscreen exclusive mode makes UI invisible)

  * If the game doesn't release the mouse lock without minimizing, you need to get help from other overlay programs like Xbox Game Bar, Steam, Uplay, Overwolf, etc.
