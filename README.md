 Prevent windows from getting focus when clicking

## What you can do with this
* Use Rainmeter (or any other application, untested yet) as gaming overlay for fullscreen games.
  * Requires UIAccess patch + resigning with self-signed certificate and enhanced fullscreen from Win10. (real fullscreen exclusive mode makes UI invisible)
